# bit-test
 Repository for bit-test Typescript file which detects and classifies all all ðŸ”¢Digit patterns that godid.io has defined except the Rare4D pattern.
Bit-test is the solution file created by Robert Liou (åˆ˜çŽ‰å£°) for .bit's coding-test interview.

## Description
 id interview- Classification project

godid.io Classification Project for bit

To accomplish this feat, I
* Wrote detection function for each of the Digit patterns at godid.io (nearly 100)
* Wrote 100+ tests ensure functions are accurate

To build the detection functions, I relied heavily on Regex (regular expressions), as well as vanilla typescript items such as Types and Arrays.

## Getting Started
*clone this file
*npm install
* Any modifications needed to be made to files/folders

Detection functions located under `src/index.ts`
Mocha testing file located under `test/index.test.ts`

### Dependencies

* Typescript (main functionality)
* TS-Mocha and Chai (Testing)

### Executing program

npm start or npm run dev to execute basic tests for the file
npm test to run through all tests
Note- if you already have your own testing file in place, then you can simply copy and paste the index.ts file directly into your own project. 

* How to run the program
* Step-by-step bullets
```
code blocks for commands
```
